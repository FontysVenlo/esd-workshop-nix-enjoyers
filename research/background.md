## Background

Over the last couple of decades we could have observe lots of efforts in easing up deployment of
software projects at scale. (note to self, there should be examples here, not only docker and guix but also build
systems such as ninja, cmake and so on).
One major issue (ref) is to ensure reproducibility, that is, to ensure that project that runs on the developers machine
will also run on customer systems (vaguely speaking). One of the tools that gain in popularity over the last 10 years (ref)
is Nix package manager - notably being used by Google in come of their newer projects (ref to Caliptra repo).
