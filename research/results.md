## Results and Discussion

This section describes the findings related to the [RQs](/research/rqs.md).

### RQ1 - How does Nix differ from other comparable solutions?


### RQ2 - In which situations Nix should be a preferred as a deployment solution?




### RQ3 - In which situations Nix does not bring a value to the project and may be an overkill?
Nix is engineered to provide three major benefits: **reproducibility**, **isolation**, and **declarative/atomic configuration**. However, adopting Nix introduces significant complexity that is often unnecessary when these benefits are not essential to a project [4][6][9].
* **If reproducibility is not a real-world priority**: Such as in single-developer, short-lived, or internal-only projects, where environment drift rarely causes issues, then the up-front complexity of Nix is not justified [10][4].
* **If dependency isolation and avoiding conflicts are not pain points**: For example, projects working well with language-specific managers (`pip`/`npm`/`apt`), or those with very simple dependency stacks, then Nix's approach introduces more overhead than practical improvement [11][10].
* **If atomic rollbacks and declarative configuration aren't business critical**: Such as projects with stable, rarely-changed setups, or those where rollbacks are handled through simpler means, the challenges of learning the Nix language and maintaining declarative configs outweigh the potential gains [9][4].

Additional drawbacks include a **steep learning curve**, **difficult error messages**, potential **disk space bloat** from retained environments, and **extra barriers for onboarding new developers**. For these reasons, Nix is overkill in projects that **do not actively require robust reproducibility**, **advanced dependency management**, or **infrastructure-as-code style system configuration**. In such cases, standard package managers and imperative setup will suffice and be much easier to maintain [1][6][4].
