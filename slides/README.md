# 2. Topic and structure
## Topic
Nix
## Structure (total time we have is 45 minutes, adjust the structure!)
- hook or "ice breaker" anything that doesn't make the start awful, something sort of - does audience know [anything related to what nix aims to solve] 5 min
- Introduction 10 min
	- what is Nix (package manager)?
	- why does Nix exist?
	- real world use cases of Nix
- Nix vs. Docker 10 min
	- (many students/teachers already know what Docker is)
	- contrast how Nix is similar to Docker
	- contrast how Nix is different from Docker
	- when Nix is better use case than Docker
	- when Docker is better use case than Nix
- How to use Nix 45 min
	- introduce Nix flakes - handout what matters when editing flakes
	- exercise section
		- introduce different projects
		- start exercise section
		- questions/assistance per project owner
- Impressions so far? 5 min
	- look back to your past projects from university, where would you utilize Nix?
	- would you consider utilizing Nix in future projects?
- Introduce NixOS as a bigger picture 5 min
- End presentation 10 min
	- further questions/discussion
# 3. Methods and materials
## Materials
Prepare handouts of something, like how to configure the flake.
# 4. Actively involve participants
## Exercises
Nedas will work on Python exercises
Michal will work on Rust/Go exericses
Kornel will work on TS exercises
# 5. Planning time management
## Planning
In total we have 45 minutes for a workshop (they mentioned 2 workshops = 90 minutes)
We should buffer for perhaps 2-5 minutes for spontaneous questions from the audience, in between sections.
# 6. Prepare technology and room for the workshop
## GitHub Repository
We will prepare a github repository that students/teachers can clone and configure their Nix flake based on the project they want to run (i.e. Python, Rust, etc)
# 7. Plan for feedback and evaluation
Can add section of time for discussion/questions.
Could also just follow-up with documentation, then end presentation with discussion/questions.
# 8. Follow-up and documentation
They will be able to keep the GitHub repository, and all the material on Nix we have collected. As well as the handouts we provided them with.
